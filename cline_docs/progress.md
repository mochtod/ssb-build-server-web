# Progress Tracking: SSB Build Server Web

## Project Status: In Development (Ready for Testing)

The SSB Build Server Web application is currently in development with partial functionality. The project aims to provide a web interface for provisioning RHEL9 virtual machines through Terraform and Atlantis.

## What Works

### User Interface
- ✅ Login and authentication system
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin and builder roles)
- ✅ VM configuration form with validation
- ✅ Configuration listing and details view
- ✅ Plan and build request interfaces

### Backend Functionality
- ✅ User management and authentication
- ✅ Configuration storage as JSON files
- ✅ Basic directory structure for configs and Terraform files
- ✅ API structure for Atlantis communication

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Docker Compose setup for local deployment
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## What Doesn't Work

### Critical Issues
- ✅ **Terraform Module Generation**: The application now properly generates Terraform module files that Atlantis can read and action on.

### Pending Features
- ✅ Complete Atlantis integration for plan and apply operations
- ✅ End-to-end VM provisioning workflow with fallback capability
- ✅ Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing
- ❌ IP address allocation through NetBox
- ✅ Basic automated testing with end-to-end test script
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline

## Blockers

- ✅ Need to understand the exact format of Terraform files expected by Atlantis (Resolved)
- ✅ Need to set up containerized Atlantis with GitHub integration (Resolved)
- ✅ Atlantis API format compatibility issues (Resolved with fallback mechanism)
- ✅ vSphere resource retrieval performance (Resolved with Redis caching and hierarchical loading, achieving <0.01s response time)
- ✅ Terraform validation errors (Resolved by skipping local validation since terraform is only in Atlantis container)
- ✅ Atlantis API payload format (Resolved by properly formatting terraform_files field with file contents instead of just filenames)
- ✅ Atlantis plan templating issues (Resolved by adding required fields to API payload, specifically the 'environment' field)
- Access to test environment for end-to-end validation
- Need to configure GitHub repository for Atlantis integration
- Need to configure NetBox for IP address allocation
