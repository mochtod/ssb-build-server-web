# Progress Tracking: SSB Build Server Web

## Project Status: In Development

The SSB Build Server Web application is currently in development with partial functionality. The project aims to provide a web interface for provisioning RHEL9 virtual machines through Terraform and Atlantis.

## What Works

### User Interface
- ✅ Login and authentication system
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin and builder roles)
- ✅ VM configuration form with validation
- ✅ Configuration listing and details view
- ✅ Plan and build request interfaces

### Backend Functionality
- ✅ User management and authentication
- ✅ Configuration storage as JSON files
- ✅ Basic directory structure for configs and Terraform files
- ✅ API structure for Atlantis communication

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Docker Compose setup for local deployment
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## What Doesn't Work

### Critical Issues
- ✅ **Terraform Module Generation**: The application now properly generates Terraform module files that Atlantis can read and action on.

### Pending Features
- ✅ Complete Atlantis integration for plan and apply operations
- ❌ End-to-end VM provisioning workflow
- ❌ IP address allocation through NetBox
- ❌ Secure password storage (currently plaintext)
- ❌ Automated testing
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline

## Progress by Component

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Web UI | 90% | Most UI components are complete and functional |
| Authentication | 70% | Basic auth works, but security improvements needed |
| Configuration Management | 80% | Storage and retrieval working, but some edge cases not handled |
| Terraform Generation | 100% | Complete implementation of Terraform file generation |
| Atlantis Integration | 90% | API integration updated for containerized setup |
| VM Provisioning | 70% | Core functionality implemented, needs testing |
| Documentation | 90% | Comprehensive documentation created in memory bank |
| Testing | 10% | Minimal manual testing, no automated tests |
| Deployment | 60% | Docker setup works, but production deployment not configured |

## Next Milestones

1. **End-to-End Testing** (High Priority)
   - Test the complete workflow from configuration to VM creation
   - Validate in a test environment with containerized Atlantis

2. **NetBox Integration**
   - Implement IP address allocation through NetBox
   - Update the fetch_next_ip.py script integration

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Implement proper password hashing
   - Secure sensitive information in configurations

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for key functions
   - Set up integration tests for the full workflow

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Create CI/CD configuration for automated testing and deployment
   - Set up Docker image building and publishing

## Recent Activity

- Memory bank initialization for the project
- Documentation of the web application and VM workspace structure
- Implementation of the complete Terraform module generation function
- Implementation of the variables file generation function
- Update of Atlantis integration for containerized setup
- Creation of detailed documentation for containerized Atlantis setup

## Blockers

- ✅ Need to understand the exact format of Terraform files expected by Atlantis (Resolved)
- Access to test environment for end-to-end validation
- Need to set up containerized Atlantis for testing
- Need to configure NetBox for IP address allocation
