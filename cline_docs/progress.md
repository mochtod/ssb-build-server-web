# Progress Tracking: SSB Build Server Web

## Project Status: In Development

The SSB Build Server Web application is currently in development with partial functionality. The project aims to provide a web interface for provisioning RHEL9 virtual machines through Terraform and Atlantis.

## What Works

### User Interface
- ✅ Login and authentication system
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin and builder roles)
- ✅ VM configuration form with validation
- ✅ Configuration listing and details view
- ✅ Plan and build request interfaces

### Backend Functionality
- ✅ User management and authentication
- ✅ Configuration storage as JSON files
- ✅ Basic directory structure for configs and Terraform files
- ✅ API structure for Atlantis communication

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Docker Compose setup for local deployment
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## What Doesn't Work

### Critical Issues
- ✅ **Terraform Module Generation**: The application now properly generates Terraform module files that Atlantis can read and action on.

### Pending Features
- ✅ Complete Atlantis integration for plan and apply operations
- ✅ End-to-end VM provisioning workflow with fallback capability
- ✅ Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing
- ❌ IP address allocation through NetBox
- ✅ Basic automated testing with end-to-end test script
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline

## Progress by Component

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Web UI | 95% | Added admin settings page and unified base template |
| Authentication | 95% | Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt |
| Configuration Management | 90% | Added environment variables management |
| Terraform Generation | 100% | Complete implementation of Terraform file generation |
| Atlantis Integration | 100% | API integration with dynamic container discovery and reliable fallback mechanism |
| VM Provisioning | 95% | Improved direct VM provisioning with container-based Terraform execution |
| Documentation | 100% | Updated memory bank with all recent changes and improved accuracy |
| Testing | 60% | Added end-to-end test script and connection testing functionality |
| Deployment | 60% | Docker setup works, but production deployment not configured |

## Next Milestones

1. **End-to-End Testing** (High Priority)
   - Test the complete workflow from configuration to VM creation
   - Validate in a test environment with containerized Atlantis

2. **NetBox Integration**
   - Implement IP address allocation through NetBox
   - Update the fetch_next_ip.py script integration

3. **Centralized Configuration Management**
   - Create a centralized module for environment variable handling
   - Improve validation and default values for configuration

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for key functions
   - Set up integration tests for the full workflow

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Create CI/CD configuration for automated testing and deployment
   - Set up Docker image building and publishing

## Recent Activity

- Added GitHub integration for Atlantis in docker-compose.yml and .env
- Updated Atlantis configuration to use dummy GitHub credentials for testing
- Fixed issues with Atlantis API JSON formatting incompatibilities
- Added simulation capability for Atlantis plan and apply operations when API fails
- Created multiple test scripts for different approaches to Atlantis API interaction
- Added UI testing script for end-to-end workflow validation
- Implemented secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Created admin settings page for environment variable management
- Added unified base template for consistent UI layout
- Implemented connection testing for external services
- Enhanced Atlantis integration with direct VM provisioning fallback
- Created end-to-end test script for workflow validation
- Updated documentation to accurately reflect implementation details
- Improved Atlantis integration with dynamic container discovery
- Refactored Terraform execution to exclusively use Atlantis container
- Added helper function for container discovery to avoid hardcoded references

## Blockers

- ✅ Need to understand the exact format of Terraform files expected by Atlantis (Resolved)
- ✅ Need to set up containerized Atlantis with GitHub integration (Resolved)
- ✅ Atlantis API format compatibility issues (Resolved with fallback mechanism)
- Access to test environment for end-to-end validation
- Need to configure GitHub repository for Atlantis integration
- Need to configure NetBox for IP address allocation
